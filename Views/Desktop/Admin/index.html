                    <p>This project was spearheaded recently. I am still trying to get the rest of my underlying foundation set up . In the meantime. there's some stuff I want to make sure comes across properly. Mental disabilities aren't as serious as some people make it out to be. Unfortunately though, most people have some form of mental disability that makes more abrasive personalities clash with each other. People have a hard time trying to understand other people especially when it's hard to speak directly to them without it getting argued incessantly. This is posted on this page because the creator of this project is making sure that there is a very controlled and standardized method of communication between not only my project managers but also to gently redirect and slightly offer guidelines for how to create a better communication standard that is nothing more than a few thin but powerful lines of code that aren't supposed to break laws. However. People are HUMAN.... SOOO.... Here is where 20 years of education comes into play. Unfortunately during the main project manager's period where he got some formal education, he had massive traumatic mental breakdowns that didn't exactly make sense as to how they can't stop happening. All of that was a product of about 20 years of complete personal neglect. Ironically, applicable knowledge isn't good enough for my project manager. He's trying to self generate theoretical knowledge through multiple future decades of development. Thank you for considering this avenue if you want to donate to help keep the site and all of its features active, I am working on completely securing with authorize.net and paypal to create a more secure future for my family</p>
